If I leave my house at 6:52 am and run 1 mile at an easy pace (8:15 per mile), then 3 miles at tempo (7:12 per mile) and 1 mile at easy pace again, what time do I get home for breakfast?

 This exercise can be done using only the statements and other features we have learned so far.

Write a function that draws a grid like the following:
+ - - - - + - - - - +
|         |         |
|         |         |
|         |         |
|         |         |
+ - - - - + - - - - +
|         |         |
|         |         |
|         |         |
|         |         |
+ - - - - + - - - - +
Hint: to print more than one value on a line, you can print a comma-separated sequence:

print '+', '-'
If the sequence ends with a comma, Python leaves the line unfinished, so the value printed next appears on the same line.

print '+', 
print '-'
The output of these statements is '+ -'.

A print statement all by itself ends the current line and goes to the next line.

Write a function that draws a similar grid with four rows and four columns.
